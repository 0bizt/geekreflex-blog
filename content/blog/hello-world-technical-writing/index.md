As a software engineer who is also discovering a newfound love for poetry, I am struck by the similarities between the two seemingly disparate disciplines. In both software development and poetry, precision and clarity are paramount, and every word or line must be carefully crafted to convey the intended meaning. I find that my attention to detail and ability to analyze complex systems in my work as a software engineer translates well to my appreciation of the intricate structures and layers of meaning in poetry. Perhaps there is more to the connection between these two fields than meets the eye.

> One could argue that the similarity between software development and poetry lies in the way that each requires a high degree of attention to detail, as well as a deep understanding of language and structure.

I've decided to take writing more seriously in 2023. Why? Becase I've realized that being a software engineer doesn't mean I have to stick to just one thing. Plus, let's be real, writing documentation and code comments can only take me so far.

At first I was a bit hesitant, I mean let's face it - software engineering and writing are two very different things. But then I started to think about it (I know it took me a while, bhuuu...) As a software engineer, I spend a lot of my time explaining complex ideas to people who aren't neccessarily tech-savvy. So why not take those skills and apply them to writing? It's not like I'll be explaining APIs to toddlers.

And honestly, the more I thought about it, the more excited I got. I mean, think about it: a software engineer who writes? That's like a cat who bark. It's unexpected, but in a good way.

Of course, I know it's not going to be easy. Writing is a whole different ballgame. I'm used to expressing myself through code, where symbol has a specific meaning. But with writing, it's all about using words to convey a message. Words. Like, actual words. It's almost too much to handle.

But you know what? I'm up for the challenge. I'm going to dive headfirst into the world of technical writing and see where it takes me. Who knows? Maybe I'll end up writing the documentation for the next big software release, or maybe I'll write a book on software engineering that becomes a bestseller ðŸ˜Ž. The possibilities are endless.
