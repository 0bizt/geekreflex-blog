Wow! I love blogging so much already.

Did you know that "despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich."?
([Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg))

Yeah, I didn't either.

```jsx
import * as React from "react"
import { graphql } from "gatsby"

import Layout from "../components/layout"
import Seo from "../components/seo"

const NotFoundPage = ({ data, location }) => {
  const siteTitle = data.site.siteMetadata.title

  return (
    <Layout location={location} title={siteTitle}>
      <h1>404: Not Found</h1>
      <p>You just hit a route that doesn&#39;t exist... the sadness.</p>
    </Layout>
  )
}

export const Head = () => <Seo title="404: Not Found" />

export default NotFoundPage

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query {
    site {
      siteMetadata {
        title
      }
    }
  }
`
```

```
// In your gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
    options: {
      plugins: [
        `gatsby-remark-prismjs`,
      ]
    }
  }
]
```
